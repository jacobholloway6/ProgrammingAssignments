Please answer the following questions regarding your programming assignment#2.


1) Please describe your design of your implementation.





2) Please execute your program by varying thread quantities: {3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}, measure the execution times and document your measurement below.

(Note: To ensure precise timing for each configuration, it may be necessary to conduct multiple experiments and calculate the average.)





       

3) Do the observed trends in the measured execution times align with your initial expectations? Please provide a justification for your response.







4) Is it possible to improve your design to achieve a greater speedup for your program?  If so, what are the possible improvements you can make to your design? 

 If not, why you think your current design is optimal?
