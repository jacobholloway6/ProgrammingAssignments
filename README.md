# ProgrammingAssignments

Created by: Jacob Holloway

Class was taken Summer 2023 

The following folders are programming assignments that have been completed for CS480 Operating systems at SDSU. Each folder contains a specific program with different levels of functionality. Below you will see the purpose of each program. Initially the program was made on my Macbook Pro but and was inteded to run on the remote school computer running CentOS. If your environment is not setup to compile and run lixux programs on your mac you may run into some issues. 

To resolve issues with compilation on your computer you will need to download and install Homebrew. Which allows for the management of packages. 
Next you will need to install GCC using "brew install GCC"
Once that has been installed you will also need to create a symbolic link for the gcc to run homebrew version instead of clang. Then you should not run into any issues.

Alternatively the programs can be compiled manually using either gcc or c99.
