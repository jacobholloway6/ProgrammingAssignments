/**
  The alphabetcountmulthreads function counts the frequency of each alphabet letter (a-z, case insensitive) in all the .txt files under
  directory of the given path and write the results to a file named as filetowrite. Different with programming assignment#0, you need to implement the program using mutithreading.
  
  Input: 
      path - a pointer to a char string [a character array] specifying the path of the directory; and
      filetowrite - a pointer to a char string [a character array] specifying the file where results should be written in.
      alphabetfreq - a pointer to a long array storing the frequency of each alphabet letter from a - z, which should be already up-to-date;
      num_threads - number of the threads running in parallel to process the files
      
       
  Output: a new file named as filetowrite with the frequency of each alphabet letter written in
  
  Requirements:
1)	Multiple threads are expected to run in parallel to share the workload, i.e. suppose 3 threads to process 30 files, then each thread should process 10 files;
2)	When a thread is created, a message should be print out showing which files this thread will process, for example:
Thread id = 274237184 starts processing files with index from 0 to 10!
3)	When a file is being processed, a message should be print out showing which thread (thread_id = xxx) is processing this file, for example:
Thread id = 265844480 is processing file input_11.txt
4)	When a thread is done with its workload, a message should be print out showing which files this thread has done with work, for example:
      Thread id = 274237184 is done !
5)	The array: long alphabetfreq[ ] should always be up-to-date, i.e. it always has the result of all the threads counted so far.  [You may need to use mutexes to protect this critical region.]


You should have the screen printing should be similar as follows:

 Thread id = 274237184 starts processing files with index from 0 to 10!
 Thread id = 265844480 starts processing files with index from 11 to 22!
 Thread id = 257451776 starts processing files with index from 23 to 31!

 Thread id = 265844480 is processing file input_11.txt
 Thread id = 257451776 is processing file input_22.txt
 Thread id = 274237184 is processing file input_00.txt
  

 Thread id = 274237184 is done !
 Thread id = 265844480 is done !
 Thread id = 257451776 is done !

 The results are counted as follows:
 a -> 2973036
 b -> 556908
 c -> 765864
